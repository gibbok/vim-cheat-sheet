# Vim Cheat Sheet ðŸ¤“

Vim Cheat Sheet, useful commands compatible with [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## Introduction

In this document, I'll share with you my Vim learnings, listing everyday commands, nouns, and movements I found useful to be more productive in everyday coding. Vim is a powerful text editor, this document is not exhaustive.

## Vim as Language

Vim commands are formed from a combination of verbs and targets. The targets could be objects (words, sentences, paragraphs, lines, the contents of parentheses) or movements (jump to the end of a word, jump to end of the paragraph, jump forward until the letter â€˜eâ€™, etc). Forming objects generally involves the use of a modifier. You can also add a count to perform the action count times.

## Registers

Registers in Vim let you run actions or commands on text stored within them. To access a register, you type `a` before a command, where a is the name of a register.
Please, note some of these commands are not supported by VSCodeVim yet.

### Notes

1. The quickest way to retrace your movements is to hit either: two apostrophes or two backticks. The difference is that the backtick goes to the same location on the line, whereas the apostrophe goes to the start of the line. There are loads of useful marks like this, see :help mark-motions.

1. Move to the end of the line in normal mode in VIM: Jump to last nonblank `g_` or use `$` which moves to the last character on the line.

1. You can use Ctrl-W direction to switch windows (where direction is one of the normal hjkl cursor movement keys, or the arrow keys).

1. The focus is on the new split initially. To move between splits first press Ctrl-w.
